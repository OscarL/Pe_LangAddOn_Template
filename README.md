# Pe_LangAddOn_Template

This is just a copy of an old "Pe Language AddOn Template" package that I had made 20 years ago.

Might need some adjustments to work with "modern" Pe, but at least the .cpp files have enough comments to hopefully help someone trying they hand on Pe language extensons for the first time.
