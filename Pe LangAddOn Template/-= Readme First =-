To recompile this add-on: (using the .proj you don't need Pe sources)

1 - "_APP_" must point to your Pe executable. (Currently it points to _my_ Pe)
2 - Be sure to add the "keyword.XxX" file as a resource. with type == "KeyW".
    Open the newly created addon with QuickRes and drag and drop the file to that
    window (or just copy the file to Pe's settings folder, that works too, but if
    you use that add on in another partition it will miss the keywords).
